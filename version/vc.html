    <h2>What is version control?</h2>
    <p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.</p>

<h2>THREE COMMANDS USED IN GIT</h2>
  <ol start="1">
        <li>Git clone</li>
           <p>Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.</p>
        <li> Git commit</li>
            <p>This is maybe the most-used command of Git. Once we reach a certain point in development, we want to save our changes (maybe after a specific task or issue).Git commit is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed.</p>
        <li>Git push</li>
            <p>After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.Git push only uploads changes that are committed.</p>
